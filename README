Ever wondered what the shortest number of links between two wikipedia articles is?
Now you can find out! Huzzah!

!! WARNING !!
BE NICE to the poor servers! Don't leave this script running for long periods of time. I know it doesn't make an enormous number of calls (its pretty slow :P) but it makes a lot more than you would by yourself.
!! THANK YOU !!
