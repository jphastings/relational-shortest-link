Ever wondered what the shortest number of links between two wikipedia articles is?
Now you can find out! Huzzah!

*BE NICE* to the poor servers! Don't leave this script running for long periods of time. I know it doesn't make an enormous number of calls (its pretty slow :P) but it makes a lot more than you would by yourself.
_Webadmins of the world thank you_

If you want to use this and you have no clue what you're doing, take a look at the README inside the @bin@ directory, or look at the "Wiki":http://github.com/jphastings/relational-shortest-link/wikis/getting-it-working.

Have a play about and let me know your thoughts you can tweet to me: @kedakai

Here's one I made earlier:
