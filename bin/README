Windows
=======
Seeing as installing ruby is a bit of an effort for such a little app for you
guys I've compiled a binary for you.

Its a bit spooky all this command-line stuff in windows, so bear with me.
 - Hit Start and click on 'Run' (Windows-R) and type 'cmd' in the box that
   pops up.
 - Navigate to the directory the exe is in (The simplest way to do this is to
   put the exe on your desktop and type 'cd Desktop' in cmd's black box)
 - Now you can play! Try these:
    shortest.exe wikipedia Chuck_Norris David_Hasslehoff
    shortest.exe wikipedia Special:Random Special_Random
    shortest.exe wikipedia
    shortest.exe lastfm_artists Muse The_Who
    shortest.exe lastfm_tracks "This_Love|Maroon_5" "Musicology|Prince"

Hmmm, looks like lastfm_tracks won't work at the moment (the treshold for tracks being similar is set to 75%, which is too high for tracks) - I'll fix this soon!

Mac OS X & Linux
================

If you're new to Mac OS, congratulations! You're going to delve into the world
of the terminal. Don't worry its not painful.

Linux users, you should know what you're doing, the instructions below are
basically identical anyways.

 - Open up Terminal (Its in /Applications/Utilities/)
 - Make sure you have the required files installed, type what comes after the
   dollar sign:
    $ sudo gem install hpricot
    (type in your password here)
 - Simple eh? Now you can play! Just navigate to the directory with the
   scripts in. If they're in your home directory at
   'Documents/relational-shortest-link' then you'd type:
    $ cd ~/Documents/relational-shortest-link
 - Now have a play around!
    $ ./shortest.rb wikipedia Chuck_Norris David_Hasslehoff

You can figure out the other examples from the wnidows section above - I'm
lazy :D
